# Testing Documentation

We are currently using Pytest as our testing framework so if you want to run the test suite. Run `pytest` from the base directory of TorBot. 

If you are interested in contributing to the GoBot (TorBot written in Golang instead of Python), then you can run tests by navigating to the `/modules/lib/` directory and running  `go test`
